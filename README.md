## General Info
This was a fun little project to learn basic HTML, PHP, CSS, & JS.
I got some help from [Pete Gregory](https://github.com/petegregoryy)<br>
The [Boids algorithm](https://github.com/beneater/boids) used on all pages was made by [Ben Eater](https://github.com/beneater)
## Main Page
The main page is just a place you can navigate to all the other pages, it doesn't do alot and has some fade in animations for the buttons 

## Downloads System
The downloads system uses PHP to create a list of file names in a folder, and then create buttons that download that file. The text in the button has the extension removed.

## Meme
This is not mine however I intend on making a page that picks a video from a list based on a hash of the date so that people get the same meme on the same day. Also I want to learn more about hashes.
